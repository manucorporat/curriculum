**2012**  

- Turn your iPad into a game console.
- Made extensive use of Grand Central Dispatch so that the Joypad framework would never block application code.
- Core library that implementes a **propietary UDP protocol** for real time input (latency below 10ms).
- Integration in my game, Infinity Field.

**2008 - 2009**

- **Freelance project**.
- My first serious game developed for iOS.  
- It was published in the AppStore, not anymore.

##Skills
####Extensive knowledge in SDK development for iOS
I have been working in the development of **5 SDKs for iOS**. I know what developers want and how to make it elegant, stable and easy to maintain and understand. Dealing with Apple's frameworks, backcompatibility and debugging.


####Extensive knowledge in C, C++ and Objective-C  
- Coding and style standards.
- Design algorithms understanding how compilers and processors work.
- High performance: single and multicore design and memory management (fragmentation, aligment, cache access).
- Expertise with imperative, object-oriented and event-oriented paradigms.


####Extensive knowledge in real-time 2D rendering  
As one of the main developers of cocos2d, I got a lot of experience in OpenGL and in the techniques used by the engines to reduce the GPU/CPU usage. I began in 2011 the development of an innovative new **graphic engine** called *FORZE2D* (see my github).


####Techniques
- Cross platform design patterns.
- Agile.
- Broad experience debugging code for iOS and OSX.


####Libraries and frameworks
- Apple's frameworks
- OpenGL (ES-1.0/2.0 and 3.0)
- C/C++ STL
- Cocos2D
- Oauth
- MongoDB


####Other languages
- Python (college)
- Java (college and Android experiments) 
- GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language)
- Bash scripting
- Assembly (ARMv7 and MIPS)  
- PHP
- HTML+CSS
- Ruby (brief experience working in Openkit)
- Notions of MySQL syntax.

##Areas of interest
My areas of interest are conditioned by my **background in game development**. 
That's the reason I am focused on high performance code, advanced opengl stuff, API design, security and monetization. I like to create great products and write good software.

####SDK and API development
**I want to make the best software ever**, and see how it runs in millions of devices across the world.


####Game engines and real-time rendering
The research of techniques for real-time rendering.

- **Engine architecture**: Reducing draw calls, dynamic texturing, auto-batching elements.
- OpenGL: Optimizing pipeline, shaders, post-processing effects, etc.
- Math + algorithms: Hardware accelerated functions(NEON in ARM), vertex manipulation, caching.


####Game development
- The **research of APIs** for game development.
- Cross platform design.
- Fast prototyping.
- Efficient assets management..


####Security
- Stablising trusted and secure connections between server and clients.
- Local cheating: Implementing safe local storage and **preventing memory cheating** are some examples (see the *OBME* project is my github).


####High performance
I spend many time optimizing, refactoring or even adapting algorithms to run concurrently. In the development of **Infinity Field**, I did a lot of reseach to run a graphic-intense game smoothly in old iOS devices.


####Networking
Recently, I started learning networking stuff seriously. Turn-based multiplayer, cloud storage, integration with social networks.

##Press and achievements
####Infinity Field mentions
- Featured by Apple as **"iPad Game of the Week"**.
- **Top 10 in USA**, Russia and Spain.

- 5/5 — *GamePro*
>A classic that shouldn't be missed by old-schoolers who love pure, classic, unadulterated arcade blasting.

- 4/4 — *SlideToPlay*
>A wide range of endless modes, beautiful production values, and multiplayer make this the Geometry Wars clone to beat.

- 4.5/5 — *148Apps*
>This is one of the best dual-stick shooters for the iPad, and is definitely worth a look if you need a good action game on your iPad.
